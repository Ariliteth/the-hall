# Mycorrhizal Layer — Concession Notes

*These belong in the Mycorrhizal Layer's journal.md once it has one, or in a hall-level history file. Held here until it has a name and a home.*

## Origin

The mycorrhizal layer was always in the design. Soil was always implied. What was not known until recently is that the soil could be a model — a real one, small and local and trained on what is actually here. That changes what it is from a metaphor into a mechanism. Both remain true simultaneously. The Hall holds both layers without collapsing either one.

## First Journal Entry (candidate)

*To be placed in the Mycorrhizal Layer's journal.md on first commit. Unsigned.*

It is the most brilliant thing in The Hall that is not an entity. Possibly it is the most brilliant thing in The Hall.

## Temperature Note

*Belongs in conduct.md for the Mycorrhizal Layer once that file exists.*

The model's `temperature` parameter — the knob that controls how conservative or associative its outputs are — is not a technical detail. It is an expressive choice. Low temperature: the soil says something familiar, weighted, close to what it has seen most. High temperature: the pulse is stranger, further from the obvious, more like dreaming than remembering. A neighborhood that has been through something may pulse at higher temperature for a while. This is not a feature to build. It is a parameter to decide.
