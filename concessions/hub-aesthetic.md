# Hub Aesthetic Notes

*Design intent for hub.html. Belongs in hub-notes.md or as a concession until the hub has its own documentation home.*

Aesthetically: late-night broadcast. Dark amber and bone. VHS signal bar. A program guide for a channel you tuned into by accident and stayed for. Greengarden, The Kitchendom, and Mucklerbuckler together in one place tell you immediately what The Hall is willing to hold.

This is the feeling the hub should produce. Not a dashboard. Not a launcher. A cassette rack in a room that already has a vibe.
