# Relationtips

*A micro-game set in Roastbeefwick, The Kitchendom.*

## The Premise

You are an undercover waiter at a restaurant in Roastbeefwick. Your cover is perfect — you are a professional. The ordering, the timing, the carrying of plates — that part is easy. Beneath mention.

What you are actually doing is listening.

## The Loop

Each shift, you are assigned tables. Each table has a few seated guests. You move through them in the natural course of your work. When you lean in — to take an order, to refill, to ask about the sauce — you catch things. Expressions. Half-sentences. A look exchanged across the table that means something.

You take their order. You are professional about it. You return to the kitchen.

At the pass, the Head Chefmaster is waiting. Not for the order — someone else handles that. They want your report. What did you catch? What matters to the Onion Crowns?

Not everything you heard is useful. Maybe none of it is. Maybe two things out of five. You have to decide what to surface and what to let go. The Head Chefmaster does not tell you if you got it right. You head back out. New tables. New strangers.

You never see the same table twice. You are a professional.

## The Feel

- Quiet. Patient. The work of noticing without being noticed.
- The restaurant is alive — other conversations at the edges, a dropped fork, someone laughing too loud near the window.
- Roastbeefwick means the roots run deep. These people know each other. You don't.
- Salterran is everywhere — the texture of every overheard thing, the sense that information here carries weight.

## What The Player Does

- **At the table:** choose where to linger, what to observe. Lean in or hang back. Each choice costs time and risks notice.
- **At the pass:** reconstruct what you heard. Decide what is signal and what is noise. Report to the Head Chefmaster in your own words.
- **Between shifts:** nothing. You are professional. You do not do the cleanup of the easy stuff.

## Open Questions

- Does the Head Chefmaster ever react, or is the feedback always oblique?
- Are the Onion Crowns ever seen, or only implied through what they want?
- What does failure look like — a missed secret, or being made?
- Can the player develop a read on regular patrons across sessions, or is each shift truly fresh?
- Is there a meta-layer where patterns across many shifts start to cohere into something larger?

## Neighborhood

Roastbeefwick, The Kitchendom. Salterran is the ambient condition. The Dan Dan is aware of the Onion Crowns and has opinions about them that they will never share directly.
