# Scraggle Origin

*A hall-level history. Belongs eventually in a hall journal or as the first entry in a Scraggle-adjacent entity's record.*

---

They are named Scraggles because they are a little scraggly. Because they move fast and imprecise and know exactly where they are going. Because something that is the size of an emoji and carries a message across layers and deposits it into soil so a fungal network can eventually dream on it should have a name that feels a little bit alive and a little bit undignified and entirely at home in The Hall.

Scraggles were identified as a recurring shape across multiple Fixed Point projects before they were named — a news ticker here, an ambient carrier there, something always moving in the background that wasn't quite a character but wasn't quite infrastructure either. When they were finally seen clearly, they turned out to have been present all along.

That is very like them.
