category: Spirit
description: A mud-coated brute that rolls through anything in its path. Has never stopped moving long enough to have a feeling. This is not a complaint — it is a complete description of a complete life.
tags: [heavy, relentless, muddy, ancient, unstoppable, simple, massive]
remembering: momentum-based — only retains what it rolled through, everything else slides off
